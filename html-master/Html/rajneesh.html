		<h1><strong>Founder’s Remarks</strong></h1>
		
		<p class=" guru grid_10">What a wonderful time of celebration we had on Friday night as current and past staff, students, board members and their families gathered to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Wesley Christian Academy.

As I look back over the past twenty-five years I can see God’s hand in providing so much for the school over the years.  From our humble beginnings in the basement of Rosewood Church to our current home in Markham we have seen many miracles.</p><img class="grid_2 simran" src="D:\html-master\photos\me.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
<p class="guru grid_10">
Some of our former students are now grown men and women and have a diversified and wonderful story to tell of how Wesley impacted their lives. We feel so privileged to have been a part of their story.  We are proud of the men and women you have become and are grateful to have had an opportunity to share your childcare and elementary years. It is for you that the school started and grew.</p>


<p class="guru grid_10">I tried to estimate how many children or families we have served over the past twenty five years and although it is hard to determine exactly (remember when we started computers were a new ‘fad’ and most records were kept manually) I think that I can safely say that in excess of 1500 children have passed through our doors.

We give thanks for the many dedicated staff that have made a profound impact on these children. As we look back it encourages to move forward with wonder and amazement at what God still will do through Wesley.</p>
